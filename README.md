## Meal Planner
  
This Python script generates a meal plan for the week by randomly selecting a meal option for each day of the week.
You can get the meal plan straight to your inbox _along with the ingredients to eliminate the task of creating a shopping list_. As of February 2025, you can now add the daily meals to your your calendar.
